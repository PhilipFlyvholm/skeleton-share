# Skeleton share

Native-like web sharing created with [Skeleton](https://www.skeleton.dev) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). The project is inspired by [Vaul](https://github.com/emilkowalski/vaul) and [Vaul-svelte](https://github.com/huntabyte/vaul-svelte), however these were not supported with Skeleton and his drawer is more focused on imitating the IOS share drawer.
